       <div class="description"><p>DivvyMaps is a Ruby on Rails application that provides optimized directions to Divvy bike riders. The application uses Divvy, Google Distance Matrix and and Google Directions APIs to determine optimal routes to and from a Divvy station, and biking directions between two stations. The app also accounts for rides longer than 30 minutes by directing users to multiple check-in stations along their route. These calculations and visualizations were executed in Javascript. The single-page app was optimized for web and mobile using HTML and CSS.</p></div>
